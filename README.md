This is a personal project to build Knowledge graphs using Natural Language using a Systems Thinking framework for modeling. I've implemented a simple but effective subgraph merging algorithm so that the graph is able to track node and relationships accross Narratives. This was a good POC to verify this would work, I am now grappling with more challanging aspects such as integrating Qualitative Physics and automated problem detection to implement David Deutsch's ideas of knowledge growth to the knowledge graph. One of my most fundamental rules while thinking of the design is that the end goal is refinement, not prediction. Take a look, SOme really cool updates coming soon!

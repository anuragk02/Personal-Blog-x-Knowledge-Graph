Category,Key Point,Description,Agent Implication,Example
JSON Behavior,omitempty fields,Fields with omitempty tag excluded if zero/empty values,Agents must handle missing fields gracefully,concept.mastery_level may be absent if 0
Error Handling,404 responses,Individual resource endpoints return 404 for missing items,Agents should check status codes before processing,GET /concepts/invalid_id returns 404
Search Results,Empty arrays,Search always returns array even when empty,Agents can safely iterate results without null checks,Empty search returns {"results": [], "count": 0}
ID Generation,Auto-generated IDs,All IDs auto-generated with type prefix and timestamp,Agents cannot predict IDs - must use returned values,concept_1758404458 created from "concept_" + timestamp
Timestamps,ISO 8601 format,All timestamps in ISO 8601 format,Agents should parse as RFC3339,2025-09-20T21:41:53.484227541Z
Relationships,Bidirectional queries,Relationship queries work in both directions,Agents can traverse graph in any direction,SUPPORTS relationship works both ways
Path Finding,Depth limits,Path finding has configurable depth limits,Agents should set appropriate depth for performance,Default depth=3 for path queries
Case Sensitivity,Search behavior,Search uses CONTAINS - case sensitive,Agents should consider case variations,Search "system" != "System"
Collection Limits,Result size,Some queries have LIMIT clauses,Agents should paginate for large datasets,Search limited to 50 results
Required Fields,Validation,Required fields must be provided in requests,Agents must validate input before sending,name field required for concept creation
Status Values,Enumerated values,Some fields have specific allowed values,Agents should use valid status values,question.status: "open"|"answered"|"in-progress"
Connection Format,Relationship responses,Connections return from/to/type format,Agents should parse relationship structure,{"from": "id1", "relationship": "INFLUENCES", "to": "id2"}

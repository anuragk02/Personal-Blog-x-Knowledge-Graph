Search Knowledge,GET,/api/v1/search,Search across all node types,q (required): search term,"MATCH (n) WHERE n.name CONTAINS $term OR n.title CONTAINS $term OR n.text CONTAINS $term OR n.content CONTAINS $term OR n.summary CONTAINS $term RETURN labels(n)[0] as type, n.id as id, COALESCE(n.name, n.title, n.text, 'Unknown') as title, COALESCE(n.summary, n.content, '') as content LIMIT 50",Searches all properties across all node types using CONTAINS for partial matching. Uses COALESCE to handle different property names across node types.,"{""results"": [{""type"": ""Concept"", ""id"": ""concept_123"", ""title"": ""System Dynamics"", ""content"": ""Study of complex systems""}], ""count"": 1}",Agents can discover related knowledge by searching for keywords or concepts

Knowledge Statistics,GET,/api/v1/stats,Get counts of all nodes and relationships,None,"MATCH (n) WITH labels(n)[0] as nodeType, count(n) as nodeCount RETURN nodeType, nodeCount UNION ALL MATCH ()-[r]->() WITH type(r) as relType, count(r) as relCount RETURN relType as nodeType, relCount as nodeCount",Uses UNION ALL to combine node counts and relationship counts in single query. Groups by node labels and relationship types.,"{""nodes"": {""Concept"": 11, ""Essay"": 7}, ""relationships"": {""INFLUENCES"": 3, ""SUPPORTS"": 3}}",Agents can understand the composition and scale of the knowledge graph

Find Path,GET,/api/v1/path,Find shortest path between two nodes,"from (required): source node ID, to (required): target node ID, depth (optional): max path length (default: 3)","MATCH path = shortestPath((from {id: $from})-[*1..$depth]-(to {id: $to})) RETURN [node in nodes(path) | {id: node.id, type: labels(node)[0], name: COALESCE(node.name, node.title, node.text)}] as nodes, [rel in relationships(path) | type(rel)] as relationships, length(path) as pathLength",Uses Neo4j's shortestPath algorithm with variable-length patterns. Extracts nodes and relationships from path object. Handles different node properties with COALESCE.,"{""nodes"": [{""id"": ""concept_1"", ""type"": ""Concept"", ""name"": ""System Dynamics""}], ""relationships"": [""INFLUENCES""], ""pathLength"": 1}",Agents can trace knowledge connections and understand how concepts are related

Node Neighborhood,GET,/api/v1/neighborhood/:id,Get node with surrounding network,"id (in path): node ID, depth (optional): neighborhood depth (default: 1)","MATCH (center {id: $nodeId}) OPTIONAL MATCH path = (center)-[*1..$depth]-(neighbor) WITH center, collect(DISTINCT neighbor) as neighbors, collect(DISTINCT [rel in relationships(path) | {type: type(rel), from: startNode(rel).id, to: endNode(rel).id}]) as pathRels RETURN {id: center.id, type: labels(center)[0], name: COALESCE(center.name, center.title, center.text), properties: properties(center)} as centerNode, [n in neighbors | {id: n.id, type: labels(n)[0], name: COALESCE(n.name, n.title, n.text)}] as neighbors, REDUCE(rels = [], relList in pathRels | rels + relList) as relationships",Complex query that finds center node and all neighbors within specified depth. Uses OPTIONAL MATCH to handle nodes without neighbors. Uses REDUCE to flatten relationship arrays from multiple paths.,"{""center"": {""id"": ""concept_1"", ""type"": ""Concept"", ""name"": ""System Dynamics""}, ""neighbors"": [{""id"": ""essay_1"", ""type"": ""Essay""}], ""relationships"": [{""type"": ""POINTS_TO"", ""from"": ""essay_1"", ""to"": ""concept_1""}]}",Agents can analyze local context around specific knowledge nodes

Knowledge Insights,GET,/api/v1/insights,Discover patterns and knowledge gaps,None,Multiple queries: Most Connected Concepts | Unverified Claims | Open Questions | Concepts Without Sources,Executes multiple analytical queries: 1) Finds concepts with most relationships using count(r) 2) Counts unverified claims with is_verified = false 3) Counts open questions 4) Finds concepts without DERIVED_FROM relationships,"{""mostConnectedConcepts"": [{""id"": ""concept_1"", ""name"": ""System Dynamics"", ""connections"": 5}], ""unverifiedClaims"": 2, ""openQuestions"": 3, ""conceptsWithoutSources"": 8}",Agents can identify knowledge quality issues and suggest areas for improvement

Get Connections,GET,/api/v1/connections,Get all relationships for a specific node,node_id (required): ID of the node,"MATCH (n)-[r]-(m) WHERE elementId(n) = $node_id RETURN elementId(n) as from_id, type(r) as rel_type, elementId(m) as to_id",Uses elementId() for precise node matching. Finds all relationships (incoming and outgoing) using bidirectional pattern. Returns relationship type and connected node IDs.,"[{""from"": ""concept_1"", ""relationship"": ""INFLUENCES"", ""to"": ""concept_2""}, {""from"": ""essay_1"", ""relationship"": ""POINTS_TO"", ""to"": ""concept_1""}]",Agents can map all direct connections for relationship analysis
